Handy-buttons-for-Adobe-9-Pro
=============================

Just save the .JS files here: C:\Program Files (x86)\Adobe\Acrobat 9.0\Acrobat\Javascripts  I made individual scripts for each button so you can turn them on as needed by loading them into the folder. I can make loads more if somebody wants them..
